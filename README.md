# MULTIMODAL ART ECOSYSTEM
### by Igor Yaroshenko | [Provenance Layer](https://line2.biz/cryptophasia)

A cross-disciplinary laboratory exploring the intersections of visual linguistics, non-human perception, and dream-state cartography.

## 🏛 Active Clusters

### 01. CRYPTOPHASIA
**Focus:** Visual Linguistics & Informed Naive Encryption
A demonstrative, "naive" escape from excessive state control and privacy violations. It is a "Children’s Crusade" (cf. Kurt Vonnegut) against the dictates of the adult world. Embracing the *Informed Naivety* of Metamodernism, the project utilizes a vibrant yet simple cipher—a fusion of crypto-anarchy and cypherpunk aesthetics.

### 02. nOn-anthropomorphic
**Focus:** Post-Anthropocentric Vision
A departure from the human-centric worldview. How do other species—ants, whales, crows—perceive our world? This project explores their "vision" of our insane industrial structures and urban landscapes, echoing the themes of Stanislaw Lem’s *Solaris*. It is an attempt to visualize the incomprehensible.

* **Web Interface:** [grdnt](https://github.com/yarosh9/grph)

### 03. SARZHIN YAR
**Status:** Deep Dreaming / Archival
**Focus:** Metaphysical Landscapes & Oneiric Cartography
A real park in Kharkiv and a dream-state territory where nature meets metaphysics. A place where water flows free and crows bring gifts. Influenced by C.G. Jung's dream analysis, this project translates oneiric spaces into vector geometry. It is an exercise in mastering the Bézier curve to map the architecture of dreams.
